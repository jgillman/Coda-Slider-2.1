# Coda-Slider 2.1 (with carousel sliding)

This is a slight tweak on Niall Doherty's lovely Coda-Slider 2.0. I loved it but wished that it would do "carousel sliding." Carousel sliding is when you are on the last slide and when you click next, instead of flying to the left past all other other slides you slide to the right where you see the first slide again. Rather than overwriting his original code I've just added it in as an option.

It's off by default so just use `carousel: true` in the settings to turn it on.

> ##Background
> Coda-Slider is a jQuery plugin I first released in September, 2007. It aimed to mimic the slider effect on [the promo page for Panic’s Coda software](http://www.panic.com/coda/). That initial version was hacked together, and I made two small updates within a few months of its release. Coda-Slider 2.0 has been built from the ground up, and should prove much more versatile and easier to use than its predecessors.
